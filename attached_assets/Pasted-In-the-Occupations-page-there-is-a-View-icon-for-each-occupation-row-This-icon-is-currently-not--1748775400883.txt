In the Occupations page, there is a "View" icon for each occupation row. This icon is currently not functional.

âœ… Required Behavior:
When the user clicks the View icon, open a modal that displays comprehensive details about the selected occupation, including:

Its basic information (e.g., ID, preferred labels, ESCO code)

All of its child occupations, along with their synonyms

Its parent, which could be either:

Another occupation

An ESCO group

ðŸ“¥ Query to get the child occupations and their synonyms:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  o.id AS occupation_id,
  o.preferred_label_en,
  o.preferred_label_ar,
  o.esco_code,
  JSON_AGG(DISTINCT s.title) AS synonyms
FROM taxonomy_relationships tr
JOIN occupations o 
  ON tr.target_entity_type = 'occupation'
  AND tr.target_entity_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN occupation_synonyms os 
  ON o.id = os.occupation_id
LEFT JOIN synonyms s 
  ON os.synonym_id = s.id
WHERE tr.source_entity_type = 'occupation'
  AND tr.source_entity_id = :occupation_id
  AND tr.relationship_type = 'contains'
GROUP BY o.id, o.preferred_label_en, o.preferred_label_ar, o.esco_code
ORDER BY o.preferred_label_en;
ðŸ“¤ Query to get the parent of the occupation (can be either occupation or esco_group):
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
  tr.source_entity_type,
  tr.source_entity_id,
  CASE 
    WHEN tr.source_entity_type = 'occupation' THEN o.preferred_label_en
    WHEN tr.source_entity_type = 'esco_group' THEN g.preferred_label_en
  END AS parent_label,
  CASE 
    WHEN tr.source_entity_type = 'occupation' THEN o.esco_code
    WHEN tr.source_entity_type = 'esco_group' THEN g.esco_code
  END AS parent_code
FROM taxonomy_relationships tr
LEFT JOIN occupations o ON tr.source_entity_type = 'occupation' AND tr.source_entity_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN taxonomy_groups g ON tr.source_entity_type = 'esco_group' AND tr.source_entity_id = g.id
WHERE tr.target_entity_type = 'occupation'
  AND tr.target_entity_id = :occupation_id
  AND tr.relationship_type = 'contains';
ðŸ”„ Expected UI Behavior:
Show the parent entity, clearly labeled by its type (occupation or ESCO group).

Display the list of children with synonyms.

Use the same consistent styling and modal layout used across the system.
